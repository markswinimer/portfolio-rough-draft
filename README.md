Hello, I'm Mark Swinimer!

## About

I'm a web developer in the Greater Boston area. I'm passionate about creating web applications and designs. I'm fascinate by the development of web applications; being involved in the process and seeing things unfold is so rewarding.

## React App

Lately, I've been interested in the React Javascript library. I really enjoy the its modular, component based design, as well as the intuitive way animations and transitions can be implemented. I have plans to create some functionality that utilizes React more heavily as I build the website out.
